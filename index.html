    <h1><strong>Artificial Intelligence</strong></h1>
    <p2>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is a branch of computer science that deals with the creation of intelligent agents, which are systems that can reason, learn, and act autonomously.</p2>
    <p3>One of the most important advances in AI in recent years has been the development of deep learning. Deep learning is a machine learning technique that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data.</p3>
    <p4>Neural networks are inspired by the structure of the human brain, and they are able to learn complex patterns from data.</p4>

    <p5>Artificial Intelligence is the intelligence possessed by the machines under which they can perform various functions with human help. With the help of A.I, machines will be able to learn, solve problems, plan things, think, etc. Artificial Intelligence, for example, is the simulation of human intelligence by machines. In the field of technology, Artificial Intelligence is evolving rapidly day by day and it is believed that in the near future, artificial intelligence is going to change human life very drastically and will most probably end all the crises of the world by sorting out the major problems. </p5>
